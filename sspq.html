                                    <p>An aircraft upset is an undesired aircraft state characterised by unintentional divergences from parameters normally experienced during operations. An aircraft upset may involve pitch and/or bank angle divergences and may lead to inappropriate airspeeds for the conditions. An upset condition exists any time an aircraft diverges from what the flight crew is intending to do. Deviations from the desired aircraft state will become larger until the flight crew takes action to stop the divergence. Return to the desired aircraft state can be achieved through natural aircraft reaction to accelerations, auto-flight system response or flight crew intervention. </p>

                        <h5>What is the difference between MRC and LRC?</h5>
                            <p>MRC is the most distance for the least amount of fuel burnt. With MRC you do not care how long it takes to fly the most distance. This means operating the aircraft at the best lift to drag ratio. As weight reduces during flight less lift will be required to balance the reducing weight component. MRC therefore reduces as the aircraft gets lighter.</p>
                            <p>LRC burns 1% extra fuel but this gives you a 5% increase in airspeed.</p>
